\section{Graph summarization}

Reducing the complexity of a graph while retaining some of its original properties is known as graph summarization. These summaries often incur an error when running algorithms due to the loss of information. As depicted in \autoref{fig:summarization}, the result of the same algorithm executed on the graph summary will be approximately equal to that of the result of the original graph depending on the compression ratio and a variety of other factors. But usually, when it comes to real-world massive graphs such as social networks, it is enough to obtain approximations instead of the exact answers with a reduced computational cost.

\subsection{Benefits of graph summarization}

\paragraph{}
Graph summarization has a wide range of benefits\cite{liu_graph_2018}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Speedup of graph algorithms and queries}\\
          It incurs a huge computational cost to run the regular graph algorithms on massive graphs. Graph summarization always produces a smaller version of the graph, making it easier to run different queries and algorithms on the summarized sketch. The result produced by the summarized sketch will have an accuracy tradeoff when compared with the result that will be given by the original graph\cite{riondato_graph_nodate}. However, the tradeoff is acceptable in some scenarios where the speedup gain is very large.

    \item \textbf{Reduction of data volume and storage}\\
          It takes significant storage to store a large graph on storage media. The space needed for storing the entire graph will be at least \(O(E+V)\). This is not achievable in some scenarios. As an example, an IoT device with limited storage, monitoring a data stream will not be able to store the entire stream in its memory. Graph summarization can be used to reduce the complexity of the original graph in order to reduce the space needed to store the graph\cite{seo_effective_2018}.

    \item \textbf{Visualization\cite{dunne_motif_2013, jin_eco_nodate}}\\
          There are two main issues pertaining to user analysis of large scale streaming graphs. It will be difficult to fit the entire graph in memory so that the visualization algorithm could run on it. Even if the former was achievable, it would be cumbersome to analyse the original graph because of the high number of vertices and edges. Graph summarization could avoid this “hairball” visualization problem\cite{schulz_grooming_2013}.

    \item \textbf{Noise elimination}\\
          Real word graphs are riddled with hidden and erroneous links and labels. Removing the noisy information makes it easier to analyse the graph. Graph summarization could essentially act as a process in filtering out the noise and reveal more interesting features\cite{zhang_discovery-driven_2010}.

    \item \textbf{Privacy preservation}\\
          This can be a crucial step in preserving privacy when releasing the aggregate numbers. Graphs are summarized with the purpose of preserving the privacy of the original dataset\cite{shoaran_zero-knowledge_2013}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications of graph summarization}

\paragraph{}
Restating the aforementioned, graph summarization has a wide range of benefits and thus used in different industrial and research applications. Apart from these scenarios, there are some other applications of graph summarization such as clustering\cite{cilibrasi_clustering_2005}, classification\cite{hutchison_compression_2006}, community detection\cite{chakrabarti_fully_nodate}, outlier detection\cite{smets_odd_2011, akoglu_opavion_2012}, pattern set mining\cite{mampaey_tell_2011} and finding sources of infection in large graphs\cite{prakash_spotting_2012}.

\paragraph{}
During this research, our aim lies in query optimization through graph summarization.

\subsection{Challenges of graph summarization}

\paragraph{}
There are many challenges involving in graph summarization\cite{liu_graph_2018}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data volume}\\
          Graph summarization primarily intends to deal with the large volume of data. Therefore handling the original dataset in order to create the summary sketch itself is a cumbersome task.

    \item \textbf{Complexity of data}\\
          Some graphs can be heterogeneous in nature, making it increasingly more difficult to summarize the graph. Considering the heterogeneity of the nodes during the summarization may lead to a complex architecture\cite{kivela_multilayer_2014}.

    \item \textbf{Definition of interestingness}\\
          Definition of interestingness depends on the application scenario and user preference. It is difficult to determine the acceptable tradeoffs for a specific summarization without the domain knowledge.

    \item \textbf{Evaluation}\\
          There are a number of parameters that can be used for the evaluation of graph summaries. A summary is considered good if it efficiently supports both the local and global queries with high accuracy. But in a scenario where visualization is involved, qualitative criteria would have to be used for evaluation as it is subjective to the opinion of the domain experts.

    \item \textbf{Change over time}\\
          Usually, real-world graphs are streaming, thus the summaries should also evolve with time\cite{leskovec_graphs_2005}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of graph summarization}
\label{section:sumtypes}

\paragraph{}
Graph summarization methods can be categorized according to various criteria.

\paragraph{}
One classification is, according to the nature of the input data; static graph summarization and streaming graph summarization. Static graphs do not evolve with time, thus making it impossible to use the same methods to summarize both static and streaming graphs. Due to their dynamic nature, an extra effort has to be spent on summarizing the streaming graphs. In this research, we will only focus on summarizing streaming graphs.

\paragraph{}
Summaries can also be classified considering the nature of the input graph; homogeneous and heterogeneous. We will only consider about homogenous summaries during this research.

\paragraph{}
There are a few core techniques used when summarizing graphs\cite{liu_graph_2018}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Grouping or aggregation based}\\
          Nodes are aggregated into ‘supernodes’ in order to reduce the complexity of the original graph. Edge-grouping methods aggregate multiple edges into single edges.

    \item \textbf{Bit compression based}\\
          Bit compression minimizes the number of bits needed to store the input graph. There are lossy compression methods as well as lossless compression methods.

    \item \textbf{Simplification or sparsification based}\\
          This approach removes the less important nodes and edges producing a sparsified graph.

    \item \textbf{Influence based}\\
          Influence based summarization aims to provide insights into the influence propagation of a graph. This type of summarization can be specially useful in scenarios where social networks are considered.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Streaming graph summarization}

\paragraph{}
Summarizing graph streams is more difficult than summarizing a static graph due to the constant flow of data. Underlying original graph is constantly updated while it is being summarized. Therefore the summarization process has to be done in realtime. Almost any static graph summarization technique could be used with streaming graph snapshots within specific time frames. However, mining information using aggregate time snapshots of data could very well be an unrealistic goal in a massive streaming graph. Thus sophisticated sparsification techniques have to be derived in order to summarize streaming graphs.
