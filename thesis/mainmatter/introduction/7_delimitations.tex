\section{Delimitation of Scope}

\subsection{In scope}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The project will improve upon the existing streaming graph sketching techniques.
    \item The efficiency of running queries on various graph properties after the sketching process will be improved.
    \item New sketching techniques along with the implementations of related work will be evaluated on a parallel framework.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Out of scope}

\paragraph{}
There exists a number of methods for graph partitioning. The effect of these partitioning techniques will affect the results of the query efficiency and thus they will be considered during the experimentation phase and in presenting results. However, no significant work or separate evaluation will be done with regard to graph partitioning. Improving partitioning techniques will be considered as out of scope for this research.

\paragraph{}
There are many security concerns with regard to the partitioning of streaming graphs and running sketching algorithms in a distributed environment. However, the security aspects of sketch creation and partitioning will be considered as out of scope for this research as they are trivial to the holistic view of the research question, i.e, efficient sketching of streaming graphs.
