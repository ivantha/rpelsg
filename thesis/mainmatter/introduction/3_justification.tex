\section{Justification for the research}

\paragraph{}
Different graph summarization techniques have been introduced for streaming data\cite{cormode_improved_2003, zhao_gsketch:_2011, roy_augmented_2016, tang_graph_2016, khan_query-friendly_2016, gou_fast_2018}. However, the implementations of these sketches haven’t been made available to the public. Furthermore, there doesn’t exist proper literature that benchmarks all of these sketching techniques and compares their tradeoffs against each other. This requirement justifies our research question 1 which is mentioned in \autoref{section:research_questions}.

\paragraph{}
Despite the number of methods that have been devised for streaming graph summarization, they still lack the accuracy to be used in most real-world scenarios. It is worth exploring intro improving the accuracy of existing sketches or devising a completely new sketch that has higher accuracy. Research question 2 is justified by the need to have summarization sketches with higher accuracy.
