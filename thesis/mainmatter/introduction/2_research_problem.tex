\section{Research Problem and Research Questions}

\subsection{Research Problem}

\paragraph{}
Restating the aforementioned, there already exist some techniques of summarizing streaming graphs such as gSketch\cite{zhao_gsketch:_2011}, TCM\cite{tang_graph_2016} and gMatrix\cite{khan_query-friendly_2016}. And the efficiency of these methods has also been mentioned in the referenced texts with respect to various queries, i.e, edge queries, node queries and path queries. Despite the improvements of the recent summarization methods like TCM, all these techniques pose tradeoffs with regard to evaluating various graph properties and only a small portion of them have been tested in the original research work. Therefore the performance of these summarization techniques must be compared against each other while evaluating other graph properties. Much research has been remaining on optimizing the streaming graph summarization techniques with respect to each of those graph properties.

\subsection{Research Questions}
\label{section:research_questions}

\paragraph{}
To summarize the research question,

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the tradeoffs of existing graph summarization techniques?
    \item How to improve upon existing streaming graph summarization sketches in order to increase the accuracy of the queries answered through these sketches while keeping the memory constant?
\end{enumerate}
