\section{Aims and Objectives}

\subsection{Aims}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discover and improve upon graph summarization techniques to derive properties of streaming graphs efficiently.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate the performance of existing streaming graph summarization techniques with respect to different graph properties.
    \item Build upon the work of existing sketching methods and propose improvements on creating and updating sketches.
    \item Evaluate the query performance of summarized graphs generated by improved sketching techniques in deriving graph properties.
