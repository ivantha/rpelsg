\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
The implementation of the research mainly consists of two parts.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The implementation of the test suite which carries out the benchmarking tests on all the sketching algorithms.
    \item The implementation of the Alpha, which is the proposed improvement over the existing sketches according to the research question 2 in \autoref{section:research_questions}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{}
The choice of language for implementation has been Python 3 as its clear an concise syntax allows for more attention to be given to the underlying algorithms rather than the language optimizations. The implementation details of the test suite and Alpha sketch will be discussed in finer details throughout the subsequent sections.
