\chapter{Research Questions}

\paragraph{}
Restating the aforementioned, there already exists some techniques of summarizing streaming graphs such as gSketch\cite{zhao_gsketch:_2011}, TCM\cite{tang_graph_2016} and gMatrix\cite{khan_query-friendly_2016}. And the efficiency of these methods have been also mentioned in the referenced texts with respect to various queries, i.e, edge queries, node queries and path queries. Despite the improvements of the recent summarization methods like TCM, all these techniques pose tradeoffs with regard to evaluating various graph properties and only a small portion of them have been tested in the original research work. Therefore the performance of these summarization techniques must be compared against each other while evaluating other graph properties. Much research has been remaining on optimizing the streaming graph summarization techniques with respect to each of those graph properties.

To summarize the research question, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to improve upon existing streaming graph sketching techniques such that the graph properties could be identified in realtime?
