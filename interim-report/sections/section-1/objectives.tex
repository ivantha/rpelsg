\chapter{Aims and Objectives}

\section{Aims}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discover and improve upon graph summarization techniques to derive
        properties of streaming graphs in realtime. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate the performance of existing streaming graph summarization 
        techniques with respect to different graph properties. 
    \item Build upon the work of existing sketching methods and propose 
        improvements on creating and updating sketches.
    \item Evaluate the query performance of summarized graphs generated by 
        improved sketching techniques in deriving graph properties.
\end{enumerate}
