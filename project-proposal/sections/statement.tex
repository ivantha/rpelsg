\section{Personal Statement}

\paragraph{}
This project is involved with Graphs, which is one of my main areas of 
interests in Computer Science. Also it is an optimization problem, which 
I highly enjoy working on. And the fact that the project involves with 
parallel computing, large data streams made it an obvious choice for me 
to choose it as the 4th year research project. In apart from all the CS 
aspects regarding the project, what motivated me to choose the problem 
was that it addresses an increasing issue in the modern world related to 
massive datasets. This will benefit lot of industrial as well as research 
applications which deals with large amounts of data. If I were able to make 
even a small change that would positively addresses such an issue, that would 
fulfill my objective in undertaking this project.
