\section{Conclusion}

kMatrix is a new streaming graph summarization technique proposed through this research. It can answer queries with a significantly lower average relative error with the same amount of memory compared to the existing state-of-the-art sketching techniques, TCM and gMatrix. We have benchmarked kMatrix using three datasets in different application domains. We believe that the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed solution in comparison to the existing steaming graph summarization techniques.
