\section{Conclusion}

kMatrix is a new streaming graph summarization technique proposed through this research. It can answer queries with a much lower average relative error with the same amount of memory compared to the existing state-of-the-art sketching techniques, TCM and gMatrix. Decreasing the error of the queries answered by the summarized sketches will have a significant impact on all the application scenarios that require the use of graph summarization. The dramatic decrease in the error of the queries shown by the kMatrix makes it a better replacement for any current application domain where TCM or gMatrix has been utilized. We have benchmarked kMatrix using three datasets in different application domains to test out its performance.  We believe that the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed solution in comparison to the existing steaming graph summarization techniques.
