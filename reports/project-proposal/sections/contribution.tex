\section{Contribution to Computer Science and the Society}

\paragraph{}
The research, “Real time property evaluation of Large Streaming Graphs” 
touches many areas in Computer Science such as Graphs, Distributed Computing, 
Parallel Computing. 

\paragraph{}
There exists many sketching techniques for large streaming and dynamic graphs. 
The research will mainly improve those existing techniques and produce 
results comparing the improvements with the existing solutions. During 
the research, we will also try to explore the possibility of introducing 
a new sketching methods which gives better performance than the existing methods. 

\paragraph{}
This project adds value to the scientific community by extending the original work 
“An efficient query platform for streaming and dynamic natural graphs”\cite{kumarage_efficient_2017}. 
There is much future work left in the original research. And we attempt to 
develop solutions for a portion of the future work stated in the aforementioned 
research. 

\paragraph{}
Massive scale streaming graphs are widely used in the industry today. 
Devising more efficient ways to evaluate their properties by applying 
sketching techniques will benefit many people. Also it will save the 
computational resources spent on evaluating these massive streaming graphs 
by a significant margin.
