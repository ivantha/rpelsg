\subsubsection{GMatrix\cite{khan_query-friendly_2016}}

\paragraph{}
gMatrix is very similar to TCM and it was proposed in the same year as the TCM. However, gMatrix paper consider about,

\begin{itemize}
    \item reverse hashing queries through pairwise independent hash functions;
    \item alternative options to extend sketch and space-saving synopses for achieving similar functionalities as gMatrix;
\end{itemize}

which the TCM paper does not address.
